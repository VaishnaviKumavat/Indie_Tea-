                    parts of north-western India, they became a part of every household palate only after the British
                    began producing it.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag ">In 1835, the British set up tea farms in Assam, India. The black teas produced
                there
                made their way into local masala chai recipes. This was the first appearance of masala chai as it's
                known
                today, complete with spices, milk, sweetener, and tea. However, this mixture lacked mass appeal in the
                region, as tea was primarily an export and was too expensive for most Indians.

                In India, masala chai is made from scratch with fresh ginger and fresh-ground spices.</p>

                Originated in the valleys of Kashmir, the Kahwa makes up to be an exotic chai with rich flavours.
                Similar to other
                Kashmiri beverages, this too, looks complex but is simple to make. All that is required is boiling hot
                water, to which, cinnamon, saffron, cardamom, and dried rose petals need to be added. Towards the end,
                green tea leaves need to be added to this concoction to make it as strong as preferred. It can be topped
                with honey and almond silvers. This rich and flavourful tea tastes best when enjoyed on a winter day.

                mixed with fruits to create aromatic or flavoured teas. Straight green tea has a clean taste and can
                uplift moods instantly. Known as the healthiest beverage on the planet, green tea is loaded with
